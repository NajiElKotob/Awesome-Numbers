* [6174](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number)) is known as Kaprekar's constant 
* [1089](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1089_(number)) - 1089 is widely used in magic tricks because it can be "produced" from any two three-digit numbers. This allows it to be used as the basis for a Magician's Choice.

* 1729 is known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number, and it is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways: 1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3.
* 2187: This number is known as the 3-cube, and it is the smallest integer that can be expressed as the cube of an integer in three different ways: 2187 = 3^3 = 6^3 = 9^3.
* 4104: This number is known as the Brocard number, and it is the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in two different ways: 4104 = 66^2 + 88^2 = 94^2 + 32^2.
* 5040: This number is known as the Euler number, and it is the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in three different ways: 5040 = 70^2 + 54^2 = 72^2 + 30^2 = 80^2 + 24^2.
* 720720: This number is known as the Schutz number, and it is the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in four different ways: 720720 = 880^2 + 464^2 = 936^2 + 168^2 = 968^2 + 120^2 = 1008^2 + 64^2.
* 8128: This number is known as the Sophie Germain prime, and it is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in five different ways: 8128 = 90^2 + 60^2 = 96^2 + 48^2 = 98^2 + 42^2 = 102^2 + 36^2 = 108^2 + 24^2.
* 10648: This number is known as the Taxicab number, and it is the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in three different ways: 10648 = 104^3 + 24^3 = 110^3 + 9^3 = 121^3 + 1^3.
* 20736: This number is known as the Ramanujan number, and it is the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in four different ways: 20736 = 162^3 + 36^3 = 170^3 + 15^3 = 180^3 + 6^3 = 192^3 + 1^3.
* 2520: This number is known as the least common multiple of the first ten positive integers, and it is the smallest integer that is divisible by all of the integers from 1 to 10.
* 2821109907456: This number is known as the Moser number, and it is the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in five different ways: 2821109907456 = 2342^3 + 746^3 = 2420^3 + 532^3 = 2542^3 + 300^3 = 2772^3 + 32^3 = 3062^3 + 6^3.

* If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9. This rule is a useful shortcut to determine divisibility by 9. For example, if you have a number like 162, the sum of its digits is 1 + 6 + 2 = 9. Since 9 is divisible by 9, the number 162 is also divisible by 9.
